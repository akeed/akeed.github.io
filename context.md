# Context: akeed | Knowledge Hub

This repository contains the markdown source for my personal website currently hosted at:

- https://akeed.github.io/articles/
- Including key pages such as:
  - Career-journey
  - Work-life-so-far

The site is evolving from being strictly an "articles blog" into a broader **personal Knowledge Hub**.

The scope of this Knowledge Hub includes:
- Enterprise AI & Analytics
- Agentic AI, MCP, and evaluation
- Architecture & platforms
- Knowledge systems & crawlers
- Labs & experiments
- Career reflections
- Systems thinking
- Research & engineering history (HPC, numerical analysis, deep learning)
- Leadership & long-term learning

This breadth is intentional and should be preserved and reflected consistently across the site.

---

## ✅ Primary Branding

The main site identity should now be:

**akeed | Knowledge Hub**

Recommended subtitle:

**"AI, Architecture, Systems & Lifelong Learning"**

or

**"Capturing, structuring, and evolving knowledge across AI, architecture, and systems."**

The site should no longer be framed as "just a collection of articles".

---

## ✅ Homepage Intent

The homepage should clearly communicate that this is:

- A long-term personal knowledge system
- A place for structured thinking and learning
- A blend of:
  - Technical depth
  - Architecture & strategy
  - Personal career journey
  - Experiments and labs

The homepage should:
- Welcome the visitor to the Knowledge Hub
- Describe the *breadth of topics*
- Emphasize continuous learning and systems thinking
- Introduce Åke Edlund briefly
- Link to:
  - Writing / Articles
  - Labs & Experiments
  - Architecture & AI
  - Career & Journey

---

## ✅ Navigation Guidance

If navigation is adjusted, prefer:

- Home → Hub
- Articles → Writing
- Add (if supported):
  - Labs
  - Architecture
  - Career
- About → About

Not all of these must be implemented immediately, but the naming should be future-compatible with a Knowledge Hub.

---

## ✅ Tone & Style

The site should use a:

- Calm, reflective, and precise tone
- Executive technical voice (not marketing)
- Systems-thinking oriented perspective
- Long-term learning mindset
- Personal but professional

Avoid:
- Blog-like casual framing
- Narrow developer-only positioning
- Overly marketing-driven tone

---

## ✅ About Section Intent

The "About" section should reflect that:

- Åke has worked across:
  - Numerical analysis & HPC
  - Deep learning
  - Enterprise AI platforms
  - Architecture & strategy
- What connects these phases is:
  - Curiosity
  - Systems thinking
  - Learning over time
- This Knowledge Hub exists to:
  - Capture
  - Structure
  - Evolve that knowledge

---

## ✅ Important Constraint

Do NOT:
- Remove or dilute existing career content
- Simplify away the long technical history
- Over-narrow the site to only GenAI or agents

The goal is **integration and expansion**, not replacement.

---

## ✅ Primary Goal for the AI Editor

When editing or rewriting content:

- Align all top-level framing with **Knowledge Hub**
- Preserve the broad scope
- Strengthen the connective narrative between:
  - Technical work
  - Architecture
  - Career journey
  - Experiments
  - Learning

---

## ✅ Author Identity

Author:
- Name: Åke Edlund
- GitHub ID / Brand: akeed
- Site identity should consistently center around:
  - akeed
  - Knowledge Hub
  - Architecture & AI
  - Systems & learning

---

End of context.
