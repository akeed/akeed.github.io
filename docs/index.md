## About

I'm Åke Edlund. My work has moved across numerical analysis and high-performance computing, deep learning research, enterprise AI platforms, and architecture leadership at scale. What connects these phases is curiosity, systems thinking, and learning over time.

This Knowledge Hub exists to capture, structure, and evolve that knowledge.
