# From Quantum Simulation to Enterprise AI: A Career Across Three Computing Paradigms

My professional career spans more than three decades and follows the fundamental evolution of large-scale computing itself: from early high-performance computing (HPC) and numerical simulation, through distributed and grid computing, to cloud computing, data-intensive science, and today enterprise-scale **AI, GenAI, and agentic systems**. Throughout this journey, my work has consistently focused on the intersection of **mathematical modelling, scalable computing architectures, and real-world scientific and industrial applications**.

## Foundations in Numerical Analysis and Quantum Physics

I began my academic path in Engineering Physics at Uppsala University, with an early specialization in **numerical methods and scientific computing**. My master’s work focused on transport-corrected numerical models for nuclear reactor simulations at ABB Atom. This quickly evolved into advanced research in **time-dependent quantum mechanics**, where I pursued graduate studies both in Sweden, the United States, and Israel.

My Licentiate degree (1996) addressed **quantum time evolution in time-dependent fields using Krylov subspace methods**, and culminated in a PhD from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology (1999). My doctoral work focused on **parallel preconditioned Krylov methods for multidimensional quantum scattering**, targeting some of the most demanding computational problems in quantum chemistry and quantum physics. This work contributed new scalable solvers for large, high-dimensional, time-dependent partial differential equations.

This early phase gave me a deep and lasting foundation in:

- Numerical linear algebra  
- Parallel algorithms  
- High-dimensional PDE solvers  
- Distributed memory architectures  
- Scientific performance optimization

## Transition to Industrial Systems and Global IT Architectures

Following my PhD, I spent seven years in advanced industrial roles spanning **IT security, product management, startup environments, and large-scale telecom systems**. Notably, I worked in the core development of **MySQL Cluster (NDB)** at Ericsson, and later as **Chief Architect for five global IT systems at Sony Ericsson**. This period gave me hands-on experience in:

- Mission-critical telecom databases  
- Global data warehouses  
- Enterprise security architectures  
- Large-scale distributed IT operations  
- Product management and system migration at global scale  

This industry experience fundamentally shaped my later work in distributed research infrastructures by grounding it deeply in **real-world operational demands**.

## Building Europe’s Grid Infrastructure

In 2004, I returned to academia to take on the role of **Security Head for the EGEE project (Enabling Grids for eScience)** at KTH, Europe’s largest distributed research infrastructure at the time, led by CERN. EGEE supported the **Large Hadron Collider (LHC)** and involved over **70 organizations across 40+ countries**.

My responsibilities covered:

- Leading security architecture and operations  
- Establishing the **Middleware Security Group (MWSG)** together with Stanford  
- Coordinating distributed security development across federated infrastructures  
- Serving as permanent member of EGEE’s executive management  

This work placed me at the very core of **pan-European distributed computing governance and operations**, helping transition grid computing from experimental infrastructure into a production scientific backbone.

---

## From Grid to Cloud: BalticGrid, Nordic Cloud, and SNIC

Building on EGEE, I became coordinator of **BalticGrid and BalticGrid-II**, extending European grid and cloud infrastructure into the Baltic region. Under my leadership, the project expanded to **6 countries, 13 partners, and 70 FTE**, and achieved strong EU recognition.

During this phase, I also initiated:

- **BalticCloud** – among the earliest European cloud initiatives  
- The **BalticGrid Innovation Lab (BGi)** – connecting early-stage startups to scalable computing  
- Early adoption of **public cloud computing (AWS, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus)** in research environments  

From 2009 onward, I led or co-initiated major national and Nordic cloud programs:

- **SNIC Cloud (Sweden)**  
- **Nordic Cloud (NeIC)**  
- **NEON (Northern Europe Cloud)**  
- Swedish participation in the **EGI Federated Cloud**

These efforts established production-grade national cloud infrastructure for research in Sweden and across the Nordics.

In recognition of this early and sustained engagement in cloud computing, I was appointed to the **EU Cloud Expert Group in 2010**, where I co-authored key strategic documents shaping European cloud policy and Horizon 2020 investments.
