*This is not the kind of posts to expect on this blog, but I feel a need to give kudos to Jekyll: thanks for your work!*

Inspired by Izhar's [How I did it][izhar-blog] blog, I tried to get the same environment, but will go with Jekyll for now (easier to get up and running - for me).

I use the base Jekyll theme (= I'm lazy). You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at: [github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
